# NULVEX Privacy Policy (Draft for Release)

Last updated: 2026-02-27

## 1. Overview

NULVEX is designed as an offline-first secure notes application. Your private note content is encrypted and intended to remain unreadable to third parties.

## 2. Data We Process

Local device data:
- encrypted note content and metadata required for app functionality
- local preferences (security settings, UI settings)

Optional integrations:
- Google Play Billing purchase status
- AdMob ad reward/entitlement state
- Firebase Analytics events (product telemetry)

## 3. Encryption and Security

- note data is encrypted at rest
- decryption keys are derived and managed on-device
- panic wipe and decoy vault controls are available

## 4. Cloud and Remote Services

- core vault is usable without cloud sync
- optional remote backup/share flows send encrypted payloads
- full sync is optional and not required for core functionality

## 5. Data Sharing

NULVEX does not sell your note content. Third-party service providers may process limited operational data according to their own terms when enabled (e.g., billing, ads, analytics).

## 6. User Controls

You can:
- delete notes and backups
- trigger panic wipe
- disable optional biometric/ads-related behavior
- uninstall the app to remove local app storage (subject to Android behavior)
