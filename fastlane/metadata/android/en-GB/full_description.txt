NULVEX is a private notes vault designed for the real world: offline by default, end-to-end encrypted, and built to leave no trace when you need it.

- Offline-first: your notes stay on your device, not on someone else’s cloud.
- Strong encryption: modern authenticated encryption (XChaCha20-Poly1305 / AES-256-GCM).
- Self-destruct notes: expire after 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days — or after the first read.
- Panic button: instantly wipes the vault and keys.
- Biometrics: convenient unlock (never used as the encryption secret).
- Optional sync (zero-knowledge): if enabled, the server only sees encrypted data — never plaintext, never master keys.
- No analytics. No tracking.

Built for privacy-focused users, journalists, activists, and anyone who wants secure notes without vendor lock-in.
